# Sorting Algorithms Visualization

Web app demonstrates how different sorting algorithms perform sorting.
Given an array of nums this of different lengths and types (ascending, descending, or
random) user can choose an algorithm(e.g. mergeSort, bubbleSort, quickSort)
and see a visual of the sorting process for a given algorithm.
In addition, this app will allow showing two algorithms side by side to show the difference between two different algorithms.

# Functionality

In SAV project, users will be able to:
* Choose a type of the array
* Choose a size of the array
* Choose a speed of sorting
* Choose a type of sorting algorithm

In addition, this project will include:

* A production README


# Wireframes

<img src="assets/wireframe.png">

* Controls will include drop-down menus for type and size of arrays, speed of animation, and choices of algos for graphs, also buttons to generate arrays and initialize sorting.
* Graph 1 and Graph 2 will perform sorting for given algorithms.
* Nav links will hold links to GitHub, LinkedIn, etc.


# Technologies, Libraries, APIs

This project will be implemented with the following technologies:
* The D3 API to render graphs
* Webpack and Babel to bundle and transpile the source JavaScript code
* npm to manage project dependencies

# Implementation Timeline

* Friday Afternoon & Weekend: Setup project using Webpack. Implement the first graph, using D3 library. Add basic controls and implement one algorithm for testing. Learn more about D3.

* Monday: Implement animation for sorting and additional sorting algorithms. 

* Tuesday: Work on the second graph and tweak controls.

* Wednesday: Style the page with CSS. Add additional functionality if time permits.

* Thursday morning: Prepare the project for submission
